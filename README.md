- 👋 Hi, I’m @xuyuan-upward
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring technology, programming, traveling, watching anime, listening to music, and I aspire to watch sunrises and sunsets with someone I love, and to listen to a live performance of Jay Chou's "All the Way North".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java backend development with the goal of working at a major internet company.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Java development or any other tech-related activities.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Please provide your contact information here, such as an email address or social media link.]
- 😄 Pronouns: (Please specify if you have a preference for pronouns; otherwise, this line can be omitted.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I attend a university in Guilin that is fondly referred to as the "Little Tsinghua".
I am Xu Yuan, and through my own efforts, I strive to turn all my dreams and goals into reality.
